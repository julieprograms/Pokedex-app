# Pokedex-app

# Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

# Context
The best way to learn about programming is to complete a project using that programming language.
To learn my way around Api, Javascript and Bootstrap, I worked on this simple pokedex-app with basic look-up functions.
There is no CSS used in the finished version of the app, to push myself to use the limited and tedious ways bootstrap offers in regards to styling.
Though I am ok with the final layout I, from now on, vow to never use bootstrap again, unless I am urged to do so with force.
This was the first achievement of the CareerFoundry Full-Stack Course.

# Features and Requirements

# User Goals
Users should be able to view a list of 151 pokemon and see more details for a given pokemon on demand.

# Key Features
- Load data from an external source (API)
- View a list of items
- On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

# Technical Requirements

# Required:
- The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
- The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
- The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.

touch interactions.
  - The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
- The app must not throw any errors when being used.
- The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
- The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
